This is a web app that clinicians can use to find medication orders and pertinent lab results for patients in a database, for a specific condition.

The condition is based on the SNOMED ID: 254837009 or 'Primary malignant neoplasm of female breast' 
We pull up all patients who are on record who have that condition. Then we visualize their lab results on the Complete Blood Count test which is used to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide range of disorders. The results of this test show how well your vital organs are functioning, and how well the treatment is killing the cancer. 

A complete blood count test measures several components and features of your blood, including:

- Red blood cells, which carry oxygen (average for females: 3.90-5.03 million cells/mcL)
- White blood cells, which fight infection (average for females: 3.4-9.6 billion cells/L)
- Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells (average for females: 116-150 grams/L)
- Platelets, which help with blood clotting (average for females: 157-371 billion/L)
