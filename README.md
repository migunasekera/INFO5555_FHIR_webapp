A web app for a clinician that shows a trend of the following metrics over time, juxtaposed with normal range values as reference: 

GCT [ 6-32 iu/L] 
ALT [ 5-40 iu/L ]
Bilirubin [  0-17 micromol/L ]
MCV [ 83-96 fL ]

The idea was derived from this article:
http://www.awp.nhs.uk/media/424671/alcohol-and-your-blood-test-results-leaflet-bsdas-012018.pdf


We currently only have one patient(default value set) with a related disease in the FHIR dataset who doesn't have all the 4 KPIs populated, hence we've assumed values for the metrics.
